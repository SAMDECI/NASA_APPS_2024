## Project Description 🌍🚀

Our project, **Seismic Detection Across the Solar System**, aims to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight lander to identify seismic events. We utilize a dataset containing continuous seismic records from these missions, organized into training and test subsets, as well as catalogs showing when the known seismic events occur.

The challenge is to develop a program capable of analyzing this data and detecting seismic events, including those that may not have been cataloged previously.

## Problem Objective 🧑‍🚀🌑

The challenge is to create a program that analyzes seismic data from the Apollo missions and the InSight mission on Mars. The project focuses on:

- Using seismic records from the Moon and Mars to identify seismic events.
- Applying algorithms such as the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) ratio to detect events.
- Handling common planetary data issues, such as missing data or glitches.
- Exploring machine learning techniques to improve the detection of seismic signals.

## Technology Used 🛠️💻

The project utilizes the following libraries and technologies:

- **numpy**: For mathematical operations and numerical data manipulation.
- **jupyter**: To run notebooks and perform data analysis.
- **notebook**: Working platform.
- **pandas**: For manipulating and analyzing data structures.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization and graphing.
- **obspy**: For processing and analyzing seismic data.
